Domain name: TheSedder

Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage, RLS)
- Stripe Checkout for payments

Core Features:

1. Public Pages
- Home page with hero section, featured eBooks & courses, testimonials, FAQ, CTA
- Shop/Catalog page with filters (eBook / Course, category, price)
- Product details page:
  - eBook: cover, description, author, page count, preview
  - Course: trailer video, modules, lessons, duration
- About page
- Contact page (form saves to Supabase)
- Terms, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy pages

2. Authentication
- Email + password signup/login using Supabase Auth
- Forgot password
- Redirect logged-in users to Dashboard

3. User Dashboard (Library)
- My eBooks section
- My Courses section
- Only purchased items appear
- Open/read/watch inside dashboard
- Profile page (email, password change, logout)

4. Purchase & Access Control
- Users must log in to buy
- After successful payment:
  - create order
  - create purchase record
  - unlock access
- Protect routes:
  - /library/ebooks/[id]
  - /library/courses/[id]
- Non-purchased users see paywall

5. NO DOWNLOAD System (Best Effort)
eBooks:
- Render via in-browser reader (PDF/HTML)
- No direct file links
- Use short-lived signed URLs (30–60 seconds)
- Add watermark overlay (user email)
- Disable right-click & text selection (best effort)

Courses:
- Stream-only video player
- Signed URLs for video playback
- No public storage access
- Optional email watermark overlay

6. Payments
- Stripe Checkout integration
- Webhook to verify payment
- After webhook success:
  - save order
  - grant access
- Payment system must be modular so Bangladeshi gateways (SSLCOMMERZ/bKash) can be added later

7. Supabase Database Schema

Tables:
- profiles (id, name, role)
- products (id, type, title, slug, price, published)
- ebook_assets (product_id, storage_path)
- course_modules (course_id, title, order)
- course_lessons (module_id, title, video_path)
- orders (user_id, amount, status)
- purchases (user_id, product_id)
- contact_messages (name, email, message)

Security:
- Enable Row Level Security
- Users can only read their own purchases/orders
- Products are public only if published=true
- Storage buckets must be private
- Signed URLs generated only after authorization check

8. Admin Panel (/admin)
