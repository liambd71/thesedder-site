PAYMENT SYSTEM (Bangladesh Only — bKash Send Money, Personal Number)

Build a manual payment workflow using bKash “Send Money” ONLY (no payment gateway, no cards, no Stripe).

bKash Number (personal): 01925545557
Payment method: User will send money to this number using bKash “Send Money”.

Checkout / Payment Page Requirements:
- Show the bKash number clearly with a “Copy” button.
- Show instructions:
  1) Open bKash app → Send Money
  2) Send the exact amount to: 01925545557
  3) In Reference, user MUST write: E-book (exactly this; case-insensitive allowed)
  4) After sending, collect the transaction info below and submit the form.

Payment Submission Form (must have these fields):
- Name (text, required)
- bKash Account Number (text/phone, required; validate BD format, 11 digits)
- Reference (text, required) → MUST be exactly “E-book”. If not, show error: “Reference must be E-book, otherwise product will not be delivered.”
- TrxID (text, required; validate minimum length 8, alphanumeric)

Order Flow:
- After user submits the form:
  - Create an order in Supabase with status = “pending_verification”
  - Save: user_id, product_id(s), amount, Name, bkash_number, reference, trxid, created_at
  - Show confirmation page: “Payment submitted. Verification in progress.”

Access Control:
- Do NOT unlock eBook/course immediately after form submission.
- Only unlock after admin verifies the payment.
- When verified:
  - Update order status = “paid”
  - Create purchase row(s) in Supabase (user_id + product_id)
  - User can then access content in /library.

Admin Panel (Verification):
- Admin page shows list of pending payments:
  - Name, user email, product, amount, bkash number, reference, trxid, submitted time
- Admin actions:
  - Approve → mark paid → grant access
  - Reject → mark rejected (optional reason) → no access

Security & Anti-fraud:
- Prevent duplicate TrxID: enforce unique constraint on trxid in DB.
- Prevent users from editing amount/product after submission:
  - Store expected amount from product price at checkout time.
- Log verification actions (admin_id, timestamp).
- Keep all Supabase Storage buckets private; content is accessible only to purchased users.

UI Copy (Bangla-friendly):
- “Reference অবশ্যই E-book লিখতে হবে—না হলে প্রোডাক্ট ডেলিভারি/অ্যাক্সেস পাওয়া যাবে না।”

Implement using:
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Supabase Auth + DB + RLS policies
- Protected routes for /library and /admin
